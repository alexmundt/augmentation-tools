# Augmentation tools
This repo contains tools for augmentating waveforms.

The timeshift augmentor class upsamples waveforms with interpolation and shifts the result in smaller increments than would be possible without upsampling.

The inversion augmentor uses a simplified inversion procedure for seismic waveforms when their moment tensor information is given.
